This event planner allows users to add any text they see fit to each hour of the work day (9-5) and to save that text to the associated hours of the day. Should they return later or refresh the page, the text they saved will remain on screen. Additionally, each hour will be highlighted with a color indicating what hour(s) of the day are current, past, or future.
